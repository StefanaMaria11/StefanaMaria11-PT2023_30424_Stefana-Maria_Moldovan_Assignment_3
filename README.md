Objective:

The project aims to develop an Orders Management application for processing client orders in a warehouse, utilizing relational databases for storing products, clients, and orders.

Problem Analysis and Use Cases:

The project involves the analysis of requirements, modeling scenarios, and defining use cases. It allows users to perform various operations related to products, clients, and orders through a graphical user interface.

Design:

Class Diagrams and Packages: The project is structured into five packages: Connection, BusinessLogic, DataAccess, Model, and PresentationLayer. Each package contains classes responsible for different aspects of the application, including database connectivity, business logic, data access, entity modeling, and user interface.
Data Structures: The implementation utilizes various data structures such as Logger, Connection, PreparedStatement, ResultSet, and others for database operations and object manipulation.
Implementation:
The implementation focuses on class design and follows a layered architecture approach with distinct layers for presentation, business logic, and data/model. Each layer contains classes responsible for specific functionalities, such as managing database connections, implementing business rules, performing CRUD operations, and creating GUI components.

Results:

The project follows a layered architecture, offering a user-friendly interface for managing products. Users can perform CRUD operations on products, clients, and orders, with data stored in a relational database. The GUI allows for adding, editing, deleting, and viewing products, providing a comprehensive solution for warehouse order management.

Conclusions:

In conclusion, the project successfully implements a product management system with a GUI interface. It follows a layered architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. The system allows for efficient management of products, clients, and orders, providing a solid foundation for further development and expansion.
